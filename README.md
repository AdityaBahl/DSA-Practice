## Technologies Used

1. **C**
2. **C++**
3. **Java**

## Why Wordle?

**Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** is a fundamental concept in computer science that is used to organize and process data efficiently. DSA includes various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, as well as algorithms for searching, sorting, and manipulating data.

DSA is essential for understanding the performance and scalability of programs, and is crucial for the design of efficient and optimized software. It is used in a wide range of fields including computer science, engineering, and mathematics. It is also a common topic in technical interviews for software development positions.

## Challenges and Limitations

There are several challenges and limitations associated with Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA):

1. **Complexity:** Some algorithms and data structures can be quite complex to understand and implement, especially for beginners.

2. **Time and Space:** Some algorithms have high time and space complexity, which can make them less efficient for large data sets or limited computational resources.

3. **Constant Optimization:** As data size increases, the constant factors of an algorithm can become increasingly important. It can be challenging to optimize algorithms to minimize constant factors.

4. **Adaptability:** Algorithms and data structures that work well for one problem may not be well-suited for others. It can be challenging to adapt and modify existing algorithms and data structures to fit new problems.

5. **Real-time systems:** Some DSA are not suitable for real-time systems as they might not be able to provide the output within the required time.

6. **Memory constraints:** Some DSA requires more memory than others, this can be a limitation when working with systems that have limited memory.

7. **Parallelism and Concurrency:** Algorithms and data structures that are designed for sequential processing may not be well-suited for parallel or concurrent environments.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, building a Wordle-like game using APIs and Node.js can be a challenging but rewarding project. By using APIs, the game can access and retrieve data from external sources, providing a rich and dynamic gaming experience for players. Node.js, a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, can be used to execute the game's code and handle its server-side logic. Some potential challenges that may arise include integrating with external APIs, managing the game state, ensuring good performance, testing and debugging, and maintaining security. By carefully designing and implementing the game, it is possible to create a fun and engaging Wordle-like game that players will enjoy.
